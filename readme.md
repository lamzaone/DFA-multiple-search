# DFA multiple search
This small program simulates a DFA and then searches for the strings within the string.txt file. This will show the complete DFA simulation and will display the number of occurences of every word inputted, along with the position where the substrings were found.
## Installation
- Clone this repository
- Make sure you have python 310+ installed
- Optionally, update the string from `string.txt`
- Run the program using `python3 main.py`

## TODOs:
- Update comments to make the implementation clearer
